# _Diabetes prediction using Meta classifer_

Implemented various classifiers such as k-nearest neighbors,Random Forest, Gaussian 
Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Light GBM, AdaBoost etc.., and measure their 
performance in prediction via Cross-Validation technique. Also attempted to combine 
the classifiers using a Meta Classifier to produce greater predictive capability
